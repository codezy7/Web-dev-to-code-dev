               <p>Solar cell phone chargers use solar panels to charge cell phone batteries. They can be used when no electricity supply is available—either mains or, for example, a vehicle battery—and are sometimes suggested as a way to charge phones without consuming mains electricity, unlike electrical cell phone chargers. Some can also be used as a conventional charger by plugging into an electrical outlet. Some chargers have an internal rechargeable battery which is charged in sunlight and then used to charge a phone; others charge the phone directly.</p>

               <p>Oxo-biodegradable plastic bags have the same strength as ordinary plastic and cost very tiny extra. They will degrade then biodegrade if they get into the open environment, but they can be recycled if collected during their useful life. They are designed so that they will not degrade deep in landfills and will not, therefore, generate methane. Oxo-biodegradable plastic does not degrade quickly in low temperature "windrow" composting, but it is suitable for "in-vessel" composting at the higher temperatures required by the animal by-products regulations. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is bio-assimilated by the same bacteria and fungi, which transform natural material such as twigs and leaves to cell biomass, like lignocellulosic materials. Oxo-biodegradable plastic is designed to degrade initially by a process that includes both photo-oxidation and thermo-oxidation, so it can degrade in the dark. Resin identification code 7 is applicable to biodegradable plastics.</p>

               <p>Compostable utensils are ones that are made of natural materials, such as cornstarch or potato starch. They are still a type of plastic, but because they are made from natural materials that are found in agriculture, they are known as bioplastics. These types of plastics decompose much more readily than traditional plastics that are derived from petroleum. Therefore, they are considered to be more eco-friendly than traditional plastics.</p>

               <p>Light bulbs that use LED technology not only bring down your energy bills but are also more environmentally friendly when compared to incandescent bulbs and compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). Both the manufacture and use of LED bulbs causes less damage to the environment than the other two alternatives.

                For starters, a 6-to-8-watt LED bulb, with a light output of 800 lumens, will last for 50,000 hours. In comparison, incandescent bulbs last 1,200 hours and consume 60 watts, while CFLs last for 8,000 hours and use 13-15 watts.</p>

               <p>When paper is burnt in the waste incinerator pumps, it leads to huge pollution. This means toxic substances are being released into the air that we breathe in, thus, leading to various kinds of health issues in individuals.

                The most significant part of using recycled paper is that it is quite cheaper in comparison to products designed using ‘new’ paper. If you are a student or need office supplies for your business every month, eco friendly diary and recycled notebook can be the best option. At the same time, using recycled paper products make you a responsible citizen and it also encourages the production of more recycled goods.</p>
